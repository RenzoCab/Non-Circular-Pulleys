# Non-Circular-Pulleys

The file sim_paper_V2.m contains the main simulation presented in the paper.
All CAD files and experimental data are presented in folders Pulleys_CAD and 20220902_Experiments_All, respectively.

First next update: Soon we will update a claner version where the used can choose any shape to the timing pulleys on the simulation.
Second next update: We will update the code to simulate the system with n non-circular timing pulleys.
